# Hi there, I'm Annie McMahon ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I grew up in Quebec, but I spent most of my adult life in New Jersey before moving to Asheville, NC, in October 2023. My journey with technology began in college, where I studied computer science. However, my career initially took a different path, leading me to work in various administrative roles. Despite not being in a traditional tech position, I often found opportunities to apply my coding knowledge. I developed Excel VBA macros and automated redundant tasks, making workflows more efficient and productive.

In 2022, I made a pivotal decision to return to tech. I earned my full-stack developer certificate through Codecademy, and ever since, I've been passionate about coding and learning new technologies. My current focus is on building applications with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, while also exploring backend services like Supabase. Iâ€™m particularly interested in projects that solve real-world problems and create meaningful experiences for users.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy hiking and exploring the beautiful trails of Western North Carolina. Iâ€™m currently working on a hiking app designed to help people connect and organize group hikes more easily. Collaboration, continuous learning, and innovation drive my passion for software development.
